# Binary-classification-ML

This notebook resulted from the writing of a thesis in the field of AI and ML. 
The aim was to make a prediction on the replacement of spare parts of TVs when it is broken. This is done based on historical data. 
The notebook bundles the main steps to achieve usable data and shows the execution of 7 ML algorithms. 

The ML hyperparameters are all left empty in this setup, but should be tuned, based on the needs ofcourse. 

Feedback appreciated!
